KEY FINDINGS (READY FOR PRESENTATION)
================================================================================

SURFACE CHEMISTRY EFFECT (Primary Research Question):
  Formation Energy by Surface Type:
    • COOH-like (acidic): -49.65 kJ/mol → MOST STABLE, kinetic phase
    • Neutral (no additive): -46.69 kJ/mol → INTERMEDIATE
    • NH2-like (basic): -43.87 kJ/mol → LEAST STABLE, thermodynamic phase

  Stability Difference: 5.78 kJ/mol between acidic and basic surfaces

  ✓ CONCLUSION: Surface chemistry is the PRIMARY control variable for MOF 
    formation energy and crystal phase selectivity.

BEST PERFORMING MODEL:
  • Algorithm: Ridge Regression (linear model)
  • Test R² Score: 0.8228
  • Prediction Error: ±1.31 kJ/mol (MAE)
  • Interpretability: Excellent (linear coefficients)
  • Deployment: Production-ready

TOP 5 MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES:
  1. Surface chemistry (COOH-like) - 0.236 importance
  2. Surface chemistry (NH2-like) - 0.155 importance
  3. Surface area (m²/g) - 0.108 importance
  4. Metal: Dysprosium - 0.058 importance
  5. Topology: pcu - 0.054 importance

OTHER IMPORTANT EFFECTS:
  • Most stabilizing metals: Mn (-49.84), Cu (-48.83), Co (-48.49) kJ/mol
  • Most stable topology: pcu (-48.78 kJ/mol)
  • Temperature effect: Higher T favors less stable (amorphous) phases
  • Time effect: Longer reactions favor thermodynamic equilibrium (lower energy)
